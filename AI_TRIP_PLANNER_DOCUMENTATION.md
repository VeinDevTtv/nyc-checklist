### **Data Structures**

```typescript
interface PlaceDetails {
  // Comprehensive place information with 20+ attributes
  id: string;
  location: Location;
  rating: number;
  priceLevel: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;
  duration: number;
  accessibility: AccessibilityInfo;
  tags: string[];
  // ... and more
}

interface GraphNode {
  place: PlaceDetails;
